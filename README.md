## 📝 Overview

TikTok Step Analysis is designed to help users:

- Track and visualize step count data.
- Identify key trends through charts and insights.
- Interact with a clean and responsive user interface.

---
## ➡️ Hypothesis
- The hypothesis states that increased TikTok watch time correlates with reduced physical activity (steps). We expected this effect to be more prominent on weekends and during evening hours.
---  
## ⭐ Features

- **Dynamic Data Visualization**: View step count trends with interactive charts.
- **Modern UI Design**: User-friendly interface for a seamless experience.
- **Responsive Layout**: Works across all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- **Trend Insights**: Identify patterns and insights from the data.

## 🔒 Limitations
- **External influences**:
  Other factors, such as personal schedule or weather, could have influenced my physical activity. 
- **Narrow Scope**:
  TikTok data only shows the last six months. Making it harder to study long-term patterns.
---

## 🔎 Findings
I will find that there is negative correlation between my TikTok watching habits over the past 6 months and daily step counts.
On days with higher TikTok screen time, step counts will be consistently lower. 

---

## ⚙️ Future Work

- Look at how other apps and platforms, such as Instagram or YouTube, impact step counts.
- Analyze other factors, such as vacations, fitness routines, or seasonal activities to contextualize changes in step counts.
